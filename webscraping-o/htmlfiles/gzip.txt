   Intro
  </h3>
  Welcome to this momentary pit stop on the road to finding what you need
    concerning
  <em>
   gzip
  </em>
  !
  <p>
   <em>
    gzip
   </em>
   is a single-file/stream lossless data compression
    utility, where the resulting compressed file generally has the suffix
   <code>
    .gz
   </code>
   .
   <br/>
   <em>
    gzip
   </em>
   also refers to the associated compressed data format
    used by the utility.

   A Brief History
  </h3>
  Back when
  <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/woolly-mammoths-walk/">
   woolly mammoths
  </a>
  roamed the Earth,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-loup_Gailly">
   Jean-loup Gailly
  </a>
  and
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Adler">
   Mark Adler
  </a>
  wrote
    the
  <em>
   gzip
  </em>
  utility to replace the Unix
  <em>
   compress
  </em>
  utility. At
    the time the continued use of
  <em>
   compress
  </em>
  was threatened by giant
    corporations holding patents on the LZW algorithm used by
  <em>
   compress
  </em>
  . In addition to avoiding patent infringement,
  <em>
   gzip
  </em>
  provided superior compression. The
  <em>
   gzip
  </em>
  utility and
    format remain in wide use, these many eons later.
