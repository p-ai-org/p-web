         FreeType version 2.9, the first release of a new
            ‘minor’ series, is now available for download.
            The main reason for starting a new series is Ewald Hew's
            GSoC contribution of making Adobe's CFF engine handle
            Type 1 fonts also, greatly improving the rendering
            quality of this ancient but still important font
            format.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you are going to use variation fonts, please update to
            this version since it comes with some important fixes.
            More information on this and other changes can be

        <p>
         FreeType 2.8.1 has been released.  This is mainly a
            maintenance release with one important change: By default,
            FreeType now offers high quality LCD-optimized output
            without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution
            tripling and filtering.  In this method,
            called
         <em>
          Harmony
         </em>
         , each color channel is generated
            separately after shifting the glyph outline, capitalizing
            on the fact that the color grids on LCD panels are shifted
            by a third of a pixel.  This output is indistinguishable
            from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.

            correct handling of B/W TrueType hinting and some OpenType

         FreeType 2.8 has been released.  CFF2 support and
            OpenType variation font handling is now complete; the

            N'Ko and Tifinagh.

            handling of TrueType fonts: unhinted loading didn't work
            as expected, and the light auto-hinter used incorrect
            metrics.

         We start a new ‘minor’ series, which finally
            allows us to activate a new default mode for bytecode
            hinting (see also the announcements below for version
            2.6.4 and 2.6.5): Subpixel hinting, also known as
            ClearType hinting.
        </p>
        <p>
         In case you are already using subpixel hinting (for
            example, by using the ‘Infinality patches’ as
            provided by some GNU/Linux or BSD distributions, or
            directly
            from
         <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161213223431/https://bohoomil.com/">
          bohoomil.com
         </a>
         ),
            be noted that the new mode might provide subtle
            differences; the code was simplified to make
            it
         <em>
          much
         </em>
         faster.  If you are used to the old
            full-pixel hinting, you will see many rendering changes.
            If you really dislike them, you can disable them at
            compile time or using the
            new

                this feature is the principle of least surprise: a
                sudden change in appearance of all fonts (even if the
                rendering improves for almost all recent fonts) should
                not be expected in a new micro version of a

            change is a new bytecode hinting mode for TrueType fonts
            that finally activates subpixel hinting (a.k.a. ClearType
            hinting) by default.

         The new release also brings support for the following new

            fonts.  All users should upgrade.
        </p>
        <p>
         A new feature is stem darkening support for the
            auto-hinter.  Note, however, that it is off by default,
            since most graphic systems don't provide correct linear
            alpha blending with gamma correction, which is crucial for
            a good appearance.  For the same reason, stem darkening
            for the CFF engine is now off by default, too.

            release that corrects problems with CFF metrics, and that

         Roadmap
        </h5>
        <p>
         Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
            help me implement the following issues.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Setting up a test framework for FreeType.  This is a
              huge, long-term undertaking that will ensure both
              stability and reliability of the library.  The idea is
              to collect test cases (mainly broken fonts) that cover
              as much source code as possible.  Another idea to
              investigate is the development of scripts that can
              generate both valid and invalid input data to
              systematically increase the coverage of executed library
              code, including the unlikely cases.  Finally, images of
              valid, well-rendered input fonts could be collected: As
              soon as a change to the rendering image gets applied, a
              comparison run with those images should detect rendering
              regressions.
         </li>
         <li>
          Further improvements to the auto-hinter.  Right now,
              the module for Indic support is a dummy, and support for
              the family of Arabic scripts is completely
              missing.
          <span class="comment">
           [FreeType 2.9 comes with
              auto-hinting support for almost all scripts where
              hinting makes sense.]
          </span>
          Both investigation and
              research is necessary to find out how much auto-hinting
              is possible and useful, and whether other, completely
              different scripts can be supported at all.
         </li>
         <li>
          Right now, rendering Type 1 and CID-keyed fonts
              is the weakest part of FreeType.  However, we now have a
              brand-new module for handling CFF.  Given that CFF is
              very similar to Type 1, it should be not too
              difficult to use and/or extend the CFF code so that
              Type 1 fonts can be handled,
              too.
          <span class="comment">
           [This was a GSoC project in
              2017, and the resulting code has been merged into

          library.
              Since version 2.5.3, FreeType already links to HarfBuzz
              to use its abilities for scanning OpenType layout
              features, and more integration might be sensible for
              both libraries.
         </li>
         <li>
          More improvements to this website.  Last year I’ve
              redesigned the FreeType website.  However, a large bunch
              of documents are still using the old design, and some of
              them are also no longer up to
              date.

         Its main new feature is much enhanced support of

         These libraries work on top of font rendering libraries
            like FreeType to provide sophisticated text (string)
            layout, being able to handle OpenType features in
            particular.  All of them
            use

         </a>
         for font
            and text encoding.
