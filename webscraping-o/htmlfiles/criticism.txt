       . CSPs that can undergo a profound transformation to capitalize on the promise of the digital era can move from disrupted to disruptor. Imperative to this transformation is the evolution toward a cloud model—a telco cloud. With a telco cloud, CSPs gain a modern platform to design, deploy, and manage new digital services and applications with greater agility, security, and customization.

       : Joseph M. Williams, the author of two influential books on academic and professional writing, advocates the use of the passive voice to manage the flow of information across sentences. For Williams, passive voice not only develops an idea by adding details to it but also tightly fuses sentences into a coherent whole.

The essay suggests that a Wittgenstein-inspired approach is closer in spirit and content to that of an unlikely candidate whose views, in contrast to the analytic school, harbor a distinctly Continental flavor and influence critical theory: Mikhail Bakhtin.

        Max Weber’s View of Objectivity in Social Science
       </a>
       : This essay seeks to shed light on Weber’s view of the applicability of objectivity by answering a question that dogs Weberian scholarship: Was Weber an advocate of value-free social science?

        Saussure’s Sign
       </a>
       : The sign, the signifier, and the signified are concepts of the school of thought known as structuralism, founded by Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist, during lectures he gave between 1907 and 1911 at the University of Geneva. His views revolutionized the study of language, inaugurated modern linguistics, and influenced critical theory. The central tenet of structuralism is that the phenomena of human life are unintelligible except through their network of relationships, making the sign and the system (or structure) in which the sign is embedded primary concepts. As such, a sign–for instance, a word–gets its meaning only in relation to or in contrast with other signs in a system of signs.

        The Myth of Psychoanalysis: Wittgenstein Contra Freud
       </a>
       In this essay, my central thesis is that if, as Wittgenstein says, Freudian psychoanalysis is based in myth, its application to actual psychological problems does not, indeed cannot, resolve them. Instead, all it can do is clarify them or present them in a different light. Implicit in my argument is that this is how Wittgenstein thought of the results of psychoanalysis, much like he thought of the application of his philosophical technique to philosophical problems, especially those of metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. As such, Wittgenstein is also subverting a larger myth: that the insights gained in psychoanalysis lead to the scientific resolution of psychological problems.

        Telco Cloud For Dummies
       </a>
       . CSPs that can undergo a profound transformation to capitalize on the promise of the digital era can move from disrupted to disruptor. Imperative to this transformation is the evolution toward a cloud model—a telco cloud. With a telco cloud, CSPs gain a modern platform to design, deploy, and manage new digital services and applications with greater agility, security, and customization. I was a contributing writer and editor for this e-book published by Wiley and VMware.
