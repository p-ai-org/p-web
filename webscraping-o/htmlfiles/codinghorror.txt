       Hard to believe that I've had the same PC case since 2011, and my last serious upgrade was in 2015. I guess that's yet another sign that
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-pc-is-over/">

       The future of PCs may not necessarily be
       <strong>
        more speed

       (though there is some of that, if you read on), but in
       <strong>

       The attraction here is
       <strong>
        maximum power in minimum size

       . Note that

        each of these cases are
        <em>
         just

        reasonable CPU cooler

       ... though the DA2 offers substantially more room for cooling the CPU and adding fans.

       I'm not sure you can physically build a smaller standard mini-ITX system than the DAN A4 SFX, at least not without custom parts!

       I chose the Streacom DA2 as my personal build, because after experimenting heavily with the DAN A4 SFX, I realized you need more room to deal with extremely powerful CPUs and GPUs in this form factor, and I wanted a truly powerful system:

      </ul>
      <p>
       Compared to my old 2015-2017 system, a slightly overclocked i7-7700k, that at least gives me 2× the cores (and faster cores, both in clock rate and IPC), 2× the memory, and 2× the M.2 slots (two versus one).

       The DA2 is a clever case though less perfect than the A4-SFX. What's neat about it is the hybrid open-air design (on the top and bottom) plus the versatile horizontal and vertical bracket system interior. Per
       <a href="https://streacom.com/downloads/ug/da2-user-guide-180901.pdf">
        the manual (pdf)
       </a>
       :

      </figure>
      <p>
       Check out all the bracket mounting options. Incredibly versatile, and easy to manipulate with the captured nut and bolt design:
      </p>
      <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
       <img class="kg-image" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-bracket-options.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
       Note that you can (and really
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       ) pop out the top and bottom acrylic pieces with the mesh dust net.
      </p>
      <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
       <img class="kg-image" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-dust-nets.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
       I had
       <strong>
        dramatically better temperatures
       </strong>
       after I did this, and it also made the build easier since the case can fully "breathe" through the top and bottom. You'll note that the front of the DA2 is totally solid, no air holes, so you do need that extra airflow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only have a few criticisms of this Streacom DA2 case:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The side panels are tool free, which is excellent, but the pressure fit makes them fairly difficult to remove. Feels like this could be tweaked?
       </li>
       <li>
        (Don't even think about using a full sized ATX power supply. In theory it is supported, but the build becomes so much more difficult. Use a SFX power supply, which you'd expect to do for a mini-ITX build anyway.)
       </li>
       <li>
        My primary complaint is that the
        <strong>
         power extension cable gets in the way
        </strong>
        . I had to remove it and re-attach it during my build. They should custom route the power cable upwards so it blocks less stuff.
       </li>
       <li>
        Less of a criticism and more of an observation: if your build uses a powerful GPU and CPU, you'll need two case fans. There's mounting points for a 92mm fan in the rear, and the bracket system makes it easy to mount a 140mm fan blowing inward. You will definitely need both fans!
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Here's the configuration I recommend, open on both the top and bottom for maximum airflow, with three fans total:
      </p>
      <figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">
       <img class="kg-image" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2020/04/streacom-da2-fan-config.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>
       If you are a water cooling kind of person – I am definitely not, I experienced one too many traumatic cooling fluid leaks in the early 2000s – then you will use that 140mm space for the radiator.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have definitely
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/is-your-computer-stable/">
        burn-in tested this machine
       </a>
       , as I do all systems I build, and it passed with flying colors. But to be honest, if you expect to be under full CPU and GPU loads for extended periods of time you
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       need to switch to water cooling due to the space constraints. (Or pick slightly less powerful components.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you haven't built a PC system recently, it's easier than it has ever been. Heck by the time you install the M.2 drives, memory, CPU, and cooler on the motherboard you're
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sffpc/comments/drvb47/your_scientists_were_so_preoccupied_with_whether/">
        almost done
       </a>
       , these days!

        interesting compact mini-itx builds

       out there. Perhaps that's the primary innovation in PC building for 2020 and beyond –
       <strong>
        packing all that power into less than 20 liters of space!

       In an electric car, the (enormous) battery is

       What killed the electric scooter back then is the same thing that
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/electric-geek-transportation-systems/">
        killed the electric car
       </a>
       of year 2000: terrible lead-acid battery technology. It's too heavy, it lacks power, it doesn't have enough range, it takes too long to charge. These are all different ways of saying the same thing:
       <em>
        the battery sucks
       </em>
       . It wasn't until Lithium Ion batteries matured that both the electric car and the electric scooter — and pretty much electric
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       , if you think about it — became viable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, one way to see if Lithium Ion battery prices are indeed generally dropping independent of all other manufacturing concerns is to examine the cost of electric scooters over the last few years. Let's consider one of the most popular models, the Xiaomi Mi M365:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/Xiaomi-Electric-Long-range-Fold-n-Carry-Ultra-Lightweight/product/B076KKX4BC">
        <img alt="xiaomi-mi-m365-price-history-2018-2019" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/xiaomi-mi-m365-price-history-2018-2019.png"/>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This graph only shows roughly two years, from January 2018 to now; it looks like the original price for the Xiaomi M365 when it hit the US market in early 2017 was around $800. So
       <strong>
        the price of a popular, common electric scooter has
        <em>
         halved
        </em>
        in three years.
       </strong>
       Very good news indeed for electric vehicles of all types!
      </p>
      <p>
       This dramatic drop in electric scooter price from 2016 to 2019 may not be surprising versus the parallel rise of the quasi-legal electric scooter smartphone app rental industry over roughly the same time period, in the form of Bird, Lime, Skip, Spin, Scoot, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="electric-scooter-rentals-bird-lime" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/electric-scooter-rentals-bird-lime.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Early versions of Bird scooters were
       <em>
        actual Xiaomi M365s
       </em>
       , slightly modified for rental. Only by late 2018 had they
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(company)#Vehicles">
        migrated to
       </a>
       custom built, ruggedized scooters optimized for the rental market. The rental industries
       <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-bird-scooters-money-profit-strategy-20190505-story.html">
        have their own challenges
       </a>
       , and ironically have started to pivot to monthly rentals rather than the classic 15 cents per minute.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Bird has experimented with its business model in recent months. In early March, the company altered its repair program in Los Angeles, which had relied on gig workers to fix broken scooters. It moved repairs in-house (though scooters are still charged each night by an army of gig workers). Later that month, the company introduced scooters with locks in some markets, in a bid to prevent theft and vandalism.
       </p>
       <p>
        In April, it announced the launch of a more traditional rental program in San Francisco and Barcelona, in which users could pay $25 per month to rent a Xiaomi m365 from the company rather than paying per ride.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       But this isn't meant to be a blog entry about the viability of scooter rental company business models.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to tackle a more fundamental question:
       <strong>
        are electric scooters the future of transportation?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Uber, as screwed up of a company as they still are, knows cars are overkill for a lot of basic transportation needs:

      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

       We have plenty of scooters here at my house, and the family and I enjoy them greatly, but I have never actually ridden or owned an electric scooter. So I bought one. It is of course the popular, inexpensive, and well reviewed

       The short version of my review is
       <strong>
        this electric scooter is incredibly fun, works great, and if you can get it for a price around $300, practically a no-brainer.
       </strong>
       I love it, my kids love it, and as long as you're

      <p>
       I found a neat video covering the "one year later" experience of owning the scooter, and what you might eventually run into or want to tweak.
      </p>
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyzdSktRfVI" width="560">

      <p>
       (The main thing to take away from this video is that flats
       <em>
        super suck
       </em>
       on tires this small, so be warned. I put Slime in my Mi's tires out of an abundance of caution, but you could also go with solid tubeless tires – at the cost of some ride comfort – if you're really worried.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that the electric scooter experience is perfect. There are some challenges with electric scooters, starting with the biggest one:
       <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/are-electric-scooters-legal-know-the-law-where-you-live">
        your local government has no idea how to regulate the darn things
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Is this regulated like a bicycle? If not, why not?
       </li>
       <li>
        Are they allowed on the sidewalk?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do you have to ride them in the road, with cars … uh, depending on the speed limit?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do you need a driver's license?
       </li>
       <li>
        Do you need a helmet?
       </li>
       <li>
        Are you even
        <em>
         allowed
        </em>
        to legally ride them in public at all outside of private property?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The answers also vary wildly depending on where you live, and with no consistency or apparent logic. Here are
       <a href="https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/new-e-scooter-laws-2019/">
        the current electric scooter laws in California
       </a>
       , for what it's worth, which
       <em>
        require the rider to have a valid driver's license
       </em>
       (unlike electric bicycles) and also disallow them from sidewalks, both of which I feel are onerous and unnecessary restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       One aspect of those laws I
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       agree with, however, is the
       <strong>
        15 mile per hour speed restriction
       </strong>
       . That's a plenty brisk top speed for a standing adult with no special safety equipment. Anything faster starts to get decidedly … uncomfortable. Consider
       <a href="https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-turbowheel-lightning-957wh-battery-2x-1000w-3600w-motors/">
        this monster of a 1165KWh electric scooter
       </a>
       , with dual motors and dual suspension that goes up to
       <em>
        forty freakin' miles per hour
       </em>
       .
      </p>

      </iframe>
      <p>
       That … is … terrifying. Even the reviewer, in full motorcycle safety gear, wasn't willing to push it all the way to 40 MPH. And I don't blame him! But now that I've shown you the undisputed Honda Civic everyman budget model of electric scooter in the M365, hopefully this gives you a taste of the wider emerging diversity in these kinds of minimalistic electric vehicles. If you want a

       electric scooter … all things are possible, for a price.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason the M365 is available for so cheap is that is successor, the
       <a href="https://www.mi.com/global/mi-electric-scooter-pro/">
        Xiaomi M365 Pro
       </a>
       , was recently released, although it is not quite possible to obtain in the US at the moment.
      </p>
      <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1i6g-la23HE" width="560">
      </iframe>
      <p>
       Having ridden my M365 a fair bit, I can confirm all the Pro improvements are welcome, if incremental: bigger battery and disc brake, more power, better display, improved latch mechanism, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="xiaomi-mi-m365-vs-pro" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/09/xiaomi-mi-m365-vs-pro.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       None of those Pro improvements, however, are worth a 2× increase in price so I'd recommend sticking with the M365 for now because its value proposition is off the charts. Did I mention there's a bluetooth connection, and an app, and it is possible to
       <a href="https://www.gearbest.com/blog/how-to/how-to-install-xiaomi-m365-electric-scooter-firmware-mod-6635">
        hack the M365 firmware
       </a>
       ? Pretty cool how electric vehicles are inherently digital, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are a few other observations after riding my M365 around a fair bit:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Please be respectful around pedestrians.
         </strong>
         Most of the sidewalks around here are not busy at all, but the pedestrians I encountered on the electric scooter were definitely more freaked out than I’ve seen before when using regular kick scooters (or skateboards) on the sidewalk, which did surprise me. An electric scooter has more heft to it, both physically at 26 pounds, and in the 15 mile per hour speed it can reach – but also mentally in terms of how it looks and how people approach it. I recommend slowing down to just above walking speed when encountering pedestrians, and if there is a bike lane available, I'd definitely recommend using that.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Hills work great.
         </strong>
         The kryptonite of traditional kick scooters is hills, and I'm pleased to report that even with a
         <small>
          cough
         </small>
         sizable adult such as myself riding, I was able to sustain a respectable above-walking speed on most
         <em>
          reasonable
         </em>
         hills. Where I looked at a hill and thought "this probably should work", it did. That's impressive, considering this
         <em>
          isn't
         </em>
         the upgraded Pro model with bigger battery and more powerful motor. On flats and downhills the performance is superb, as you'd expect. That said, if you are a really big or tall adult, or live in a particularly hilly area, wait for the Pro model or an equivalent.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Portability is good, but borderline.
         </strong>
         At ~26 pounds, the electric scooter is reasonably portable, but it's not something you a) could really get away with taking inside a restaurant / store with you to prevent theft or b) want to be carrying around on your person for any significant length of time. It's not nearly as nimble or portable as a kick scooter, but that's a high bar. You'll need to carry a bike lock and think about how to lock your scooter on bike racks, which turned out to be … more geometrically challenging than I anticipated due to the small tires, disc brakes, and the engine in the front wheel. They need more obvious locking points on the chassis.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       To be honest with you I'm still bitter about the whole
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_Inc.">
        Segway
       </a>
       debacle. There was so much hype back in the day. That ridiculous thing was
       <a href="https://www.wired.com/2009/12/1203segway-unveiled/">
        supposed to change the world

       A Segway was $5,000 at launch in 2001, which is a whopping $7,248 in inflation adjusted dollars. Here in 2019, cheap $200 to $300 electric scooters are basically the transformational technology the Segway was
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       to be, aren't they? Are electric scooters the future of (most) transportation? I'm not sure, but I do like where we're headed, even if it took us twenty years to get there.

       I've never thought of myself as a "car person". The last new car I bought (and in fact, now that I think about it, the

       new car I ever bought) was the

       . Since then we bought a VW station wagon in 2011 and a Honda minivan in 2012 for family transportation duties. That's it. Not exactly the stuff

       I'm here to tell you that a station wagon doesn't

       After 7 years, the station wagon had to go. We initially looked at hybrids because, well,

       It's been 5 years, but from time to time I'd see some electric vehicle on the road and I'd think about that
       <strong>
        Intergalactic SpaceBoat of Light and Wonder
       </strong>
       . Maybe it's time for our family to jump on the electric car trend, too, and just late enough that we can avoid the bleeding edge and end up merely on the …
       <em>
        leading
       </em>
       edge?
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we're now the proud owners of a

       I've somehow gone from being a person who basically doesn't care about cars at all … to being
       <strong>
        one of those insufferable electric car people who won't shut up about them
       </strong>
       .  I apologize in advance. If you suddenly feel an overwhelming urge to close this browser tab, I don't blame you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was expecting another car, like the three we bought before. What I got, instead, was a transformation:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Yes, yes, electric cars are clean, but it's a revelation how clean
         <em>
          everything
         </em>
         is in an electric. You take for granted how dirty and noisy gas based cars are in daily operation – the engine noise, the exhaust fumes, the brake dust on the rims, the oily residues and thin black film that descends on everything, the way you have to wash your hands every time you use the gas station pumps. You don't fully appreciate how oppressive those little dirty details were until they're gone.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Electric cars are (almost) completely silent. I guess technically in 2019 electric cars require artificial soundmakers at low speed for safety, and this car has one. But The Oatmeal was right. Electric cars
         <em>
          feel
         </em>
         like spacecraft because they move so effortlessly. There's virtually no delay from action to reaction, near immediate acceleration and deceleration … with almost no sound or vibration at all, like you're in freakin' space! It's so immensely satisfying!
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Electric cars aren't just
         <em>
          electric
         </em>
         , they're utterly digital to their very core. Gas cars always felt like the classic 1950s Pixar Cars world of grease monkeys and machine shop guys, maybe with a few digital bobbins added here and there as an afterthought. This electric car, on the other hand, is squarely in the post-iPhone world of everyday digital gadgets. It feels more like a giant smartphone than a car. I am a programmer, I'm a digital guy, I love digital stuff. And electric cars are part of
         <em>
          my
         </em>
         world, rather than the other way around. It feels good.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Electric cars are mechanically much simpler than gasoline cars, which means they are inherently more reliable and cheaper to maintain. An internal combustion engine has hundreds of moving parts, many of which require regular maintenance, fluids, filters, and tune ups. It also has a complex transmission to translate the narrow power band of a gas powered engine. None of this is necessary on an electric vehicle, whose electric motor is basically one moving part with simple 100% direct drive from the motor to the wheels. This newfound simplicity is deeply appealing to a guy who always saw cars as incredibly complicated (but computers, not so much).

         Being able to charge at home overnight is perhaps the most radical transformation of all. Your house is now a "gas station". Our Kia Niro has a range of about
         <strong>
          250 miles
         </strong>
         on a full battery. With any modern electric car, provided you drive less than 200 miles a day round trip (who even drives this much?), it's very unlikely you'll ever need to "fill the tank" anywhere but at home. Ever. It's so strange to think that in 50 years, gas stations
         <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/As-EVs-threaten-gas-stations-owners-turn-to-14291843.php">
          may eventually be as odd to see in public as telephone booths now are
         </a>
         . Our charger is, conveniently enough, right next to the driveway since that's where the power breaker box was. With the level 2 charger installed, it literally
         <em>
          looks
         </em>
         like a gas pump on the side of the house, except this one "pumps" … electrons.
        </p>
       </li>

      </p>
      <p>
       This electric car is such a great experience. It's so much better than our gas powered station wagon that I swear, if there was a fully electric minivan (there isn't) I would literally sell our Honda minivan
       <em>
        tomorrow
       </em>
       and switch over. Without question. And believe me, I had no plans to sell that vehicle two months ago. The electric car is
       <em>
        that much better
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I was expecting "yet another car", but what I got instead was a new, radical worldview. Driving a car powered by barely controlled liquid fuel detonations used to be normal. But in an world of more and more viable electric vehicles this status quo increasingly starts to feel … deeply unnatural. Electric is so much better of an overall experience that you begin to wonder: why did we
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       do it that way?
      </p>
      <p>
       Gas cars seem, for lack of a better word,
       <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-ev-oil-crisis/">
        <em>
         obsolete

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       How did this transformation happen, from my perspective, so suddenly? When exactly did electric cars go from "expensive, experimental thing for crazy people" to "By God, I'll never buy another old fashioned gasoline based car if I can help it"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I was vaguely aware of the early electric cars. I even remember one coworker circa 2001 who owned a bright neon green Honda Insight. I ignored it all because, like I said,
       <em>
        I'm not a car guy
       </em>
       . I needed to do the research to understand the history, and I started with the often recommended documentary
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F">
        Who Killed the Electric Car?
       </a>

      </iframe>
      <p>
       This is mostly about the original highly experimental
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1">
        General Motors EV1
       </a>
       from 1996 to 1999. It's so early the first models had lead-acid batteries! 😱 There's a number of conspiracy theories floated in the video, but I think the simple answer to the implied question in the title is straight up
       <em>
        price
       </em>
       . The battery tech was nowhere near ready, and per the Wikipedia article the estimated actual cost of the car was somewhere between $100,000 and $250,000 though I suspect it was much closer to the latter. It is interesting to note how much the owners (well, leasers) loved their EV1s. Having gone through that same conversion myself, I empathize!
      </p>
      <p>
       I then watched the sequel,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Electric_Car">
        Revenge of the Electric Car
       </a>
       . This one is essential, because it covers the dawn of the modern electric car we have today.

      <p>
       This chronicles the creation of three very influential early electric cars — the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_Leaf">
        Nissan Leaf
       </a>
       , the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Volt">

       </a>
       , and of course the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(2008)">
        Tesla Roadster
       </a>
       from 2005 - 2008. The precise moment that Lithium-Ion batteries were in play – that's when electric cars started to become viable. Every one of these three electric cars was well conceived and made it to market in volume, though not without significant challenges, both internal and external. None of them were perfect electric vehicles by any means: the Roadster was $100k, the Leaf had limited range, and the Volt was still technically a hybrid, albeit only using the gasoline engine to charge the battery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten years later, Tesla has the model 3 at $38,000 and we bought our Kia Niro for about the same price. After national and state tax incentives and rebates, that puts the price at around $30,000. It's not as cheap as it needs to be … yet. But it's getting there. And it's
       <a href="https://www.corporateknights.com/channels/clean-technology/faceoff-electric-vs-gas-cars-on-cost-15555966/">

      <p>
       It's still early, but the trend lines are clear. And I'm here to tell you that right now, today, I'd buy
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       modern electric car over a gasoline powered car.

        I bet if you went to a client and presented a 200 kilobyte site template, you’d be fired. Even if it looked great and somehow included all the tracking and ads and social media crap they insisted on putting in. It’s just so far out of the realm of the imaginable at this point.

       <strong>
        The bad guy is
        <em>
         advertising
        </em>
       </strong>
       . Unlimited, unfettered ad "tech" has creeped into everything and subsumed the web.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't even want to run ad blockers, and I didn't for a long time – but it's increasingly difficult to avoid running an ad blocker unless you want a clunky, substandard web experience. There's a
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       the most popular browser plugins are inevitably ad blockers, isn't there? Just ask Google:
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="chrome-best-extensions-google-search" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/05/chrome-best-extensions-google-search.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       So it's all the more surprising to learn that Google is
       <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/05/29/chrome-ad-blocking-enterprise-manifest-v3/">
        suddenly clamping down hard on adblockers in Chrome
       </a>
       .  Here's what the author of uBlock Origin, an ad blocking plugin for Chrome,
       <a href="https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uBlock-issues/issues/338#issuecomment-496009417">
        has to say
       </a>
       about today's announcement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In order for Google Chrome to reach its current user base, it had to support content blockers — these are the top most popular extensions for any browser. Google strategy has been to find the optimal point between the two goals of growing the user base of Google Chrome and preventing content blockers from harming its business.
       </p>
       <p>
        The blocking ability of the webRequest API caused Google to yield control of content blocking to content blockers. Now that Google Chrome is the dominant browser, it is in a better position to shift the optimal point between the two goals which benefits Google's primary business.
       </p>
       <p>
        The deprecation of the blocking ability of the webRequest API is to gain back this control, and to further instrument and report how web pages are filtered, since the exact filters which are applied to web pages are useful information which will be collectable by Google Chrome.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The ad blockers themselves are arguably just as complicit. Eye/o GmbH owns
       <a href="https://adblockplus.org/">
        AdBlock

        paid "Acceptable Ads" program
       </a>
       is a way to funnel money into adblockers to, uh,
       <em>
        encourage
       </em>
       them to display certain ads. With money. Lots … and lots … of money. 🤑

       . It's kind of scary how powerful DNS can be, isn't it?

       My Pi-Hole took me about 1 hour to set up, start to finish. All you need is
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        a
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BC7BMHY/?tag=codihorr-20">
         Raspberry Pi 3b+ kit
        </a>
        $59
       </li>
       <li>
        a quality
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00WR4IJBE/?tag=codihorr-20">
         32GB SD card

        $9
       </li>
       <li>
        an ethernet cable
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I do recommend the 3b+ because it has
       <a href="https://www.pidramble.com/wiki/benchmarks/networking">
        native gigabit ethernet
       </a>
       and a bit more muscle. But
       <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/what-model-raspberry-pi-should-i-use-for-pi-hole/9635">
        literally any Raspberry Pi
       </a>
       you can find laying around will work, though I'd
       <em>
        strongly
       </em>
       advise you to pick one with a wired ethernet port since it'll be your DNS server.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to write a whole Pi-Hole installation guide, because there are
       <a href="https://www.smarthomebeginner.com/pi-hole-tutorial-whole-home-ad-blocking/">
        lots of great ones
       </a>
       out there already. It's not difficult, and there's a slick web GUI waiting for you once you complete initial setup. For your initial testing, pick any IP address you like on your network that won't conflict with anything active. Once you're happy with the basic setup and web interface:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Turn OFF your router's DHCP server – existing leases will continue to work, so nothing will be immediately broken.
       </li>
       <li>
        Turn ON the pi-hole DHCP server, in the web GUI.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <img alt="pi-hole-dhcp-server" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/05/pi-hole-dhcp-server.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you do this, all your network devices will start to grab their DHCP leases from your Pi-Hole, which will
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       tell them to route all their DNS requests through the Pi-Hole, and that's when the ✨ magic ✨ happens!
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="pi-hole-blacklists" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/05/pi-hole-blacklists.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       All those DNS requests from all the devices on your network will be checked against the ad blacklists; anything matching is quickly and silently discarded
       <strong>
        before it ever reaches your browser.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="pi-hole-dashboard-stats" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/05/pi-hole-dashboard-stats.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       (The Pi-Hole also acts as a
       <a href="https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/will-pi-hole-slow-down-my-network/2048">
        caching DNS server
       </a>
       , so repeated DNS requests will be serviced rapidly from your local network, too.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're worried about stability or reliability, you can easily add a cheap battery backed USB plug, or even a second backup Pi-Hole as your secondary DNS provider if you prefer belt and suspenders protection. Switching back to plain boring old vanilla DNS is as easy as unplugging the Pi and flicking the DHCP server setting in your router back on.

       I avoided the Pi-Hole project for a while because I didn't need it, and I'd honestly rather jump in later when things are more mature.

       When we started
       <a href="https://discourse.org">
        Discourse
       </a>
       in 2013, our server requirements were high:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        1GB RAM
       </li>
       <li>
        modern, fast dual core CPU
       </li>
       <li>
        speedy solid state drive with 20+ GB
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not talking about a cheapo shared cpanel server, either, I mean a
       <em>
        dedicated
       </em>
       virtual private server with those specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were OK with that, because we were
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-ruby/">
        building in Ruby
       </a>
       for the next decade of the Internet. I predicted early on that the cost of renting a suitable VPS would drop to $5 per month, and courtesy of Digital Ocean that indeed
       <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/new-digital-ocean-pricing-spoiler-5-for-a-1gb-droplet/78230">
        happened in January 2018
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The cloud got cheaper, and faster. Not really a surprise, since
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/when-hardware-is-free-power-is-expensive/">
        the price of hardware trends to zero over time
       </a>
       . But it's still the cloud, and that means it isn't exactly
       <em>
        cheap
       </em>
       . It is, after all, someone else's computer that you pay for the privilege of renting.
      </p>

       <img alt="there-is-no-cloud" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/02/there-is-no-cloud.png"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       But wait …
       <strong>
        what if you could put your
        <em>
         own
        </em>
        computer "in the cloud"?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't that be the best of both worlds? Reliable connectivity,  plus a nice low monthly price for extremely fast hardware? If this sounds crazy, it shouldn't – Mac users have been doing this
       <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/pricing/colo">
        for years now
       </a>
       .

      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose it's understandable that Mac users would be on the cutting edge here since Apple
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xserve#Intel_Xserve">
        barely makes server hardware
       </a>
       , whereas the PC world has always been
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/building-a-computer-the-google-way/">
        the literal de-facto standard for server hardware
       </a>
       .

       Given the prevalence and maturity of cloud providers, it's even a
       <em>
        little
       </em>
       controversial these days to
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/building-servers-for-fun-and-prof-ok-maybe-just-for-fun/">
        colocate actual servers
       </a>
       . We've also experimented with
       <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-scooter-computer/">
        colocating mini-pcs
       </a>
       in various hosting roles. I'm still curious why there isn't more of a cottage industry for colocating mini PCs. Because …

        I think there should be

       .

       we added to our Discourse infrastructure in 2016, plus my own colocation experiment that ran concurrently.
       <strong>
        Over the last three years of both experiments, I've concluded that these little boxes are plenty reliable
       </strong>
       , with one role specific caveat that I'll explain in the comments. I remain an unabashed fan of mini-PC colocation. I like it so much I put together a new 2019 iteration:

       It also has a rather elegant dual-sided internal layout. There is a slot for an old-school 2.5" drive, plus built in wi-fi, but you won't see it in my pictures because I physically removed both.

       I'd expect around 10 - 20 watts doing typical low-load stuff that isn't super CPU intensive. Note that running current-ish versions of
       <code>
        mprime
       </code>
       jacks power consumption up to 75w 🔥 and the overall clock scales down to 3.1 Ghz … let me tell you, I've learned to be
       <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-dangers-of-intels-frequency-scaling/">
        very,
        <em>
         very
        </em>
        afraid of AVX2 extensions
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       (If you're worried about noise, don't be. This active cooling solution is clearly overkill for a 65w load, because it barely spun up at all even under full core load. It was
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       quiet.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're happy that this machine is a slammin' deal for $820, it's super fast, and plenty reliable. But how about colocation costs? My colocation provider is
       <a href="https://endoffice.com/">
        EndOffice
       </a>
       out of Boston, and they offer very competitive rates to colocate a Mini-PC: $29/month.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://endoffice.com/minicolo.html">
        <img alt="endoffice-mini-pc-colocation" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/02/endoffice-mini-pc-colocation.png"/>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally colocate three Mini-PCs for redundancy and just-in-case; there are discounts for colocating more than one. Here they are racked up and in action. Of course I labelled the front and rear before shipping because that's how I roll.
      </p>
      <p>
       <img alt="endoffice-colocated-2019-mini-pcs" src="https://blog.codinghorror.com/content/images/2019/02/endoffice-colocated-2019-mini-pcs.jpg"/>
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's break this down and see what the actual costs of colocating a Mini-PC are versus the cloud. Given the plateauing of CPU speeds, I think five years of useful life for these boxes is realistic, but let's assume a conservative three year lifespan to be safe.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        $880 mini-pc 32GB RAM, 6 CPUs, 500GB SSD
       </li>
       <li>
        $120 taxes / shipping / misc
       </li>
       <li>
        $29 × 12 × 3 = $1,044
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       That's
       <strong>
        $2,044 for three years of hosting
       </strong>
       . How can we do on Digital Ocean? Per
       <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/">
        their current pricing page
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        32GB RAM, 8 vCPUs, 640GB SSD
       </li>
       <li>
        $160/month
       </li>
       <li>
        $160 × 12 × 3 =
        <strong>
         $5,760
        </strong>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This isn't
       <em>
        quite
       </em>
       apples to apples, as we are getting an extra 140GB of disk and 2 bonus CPUs, but those CPUs are both slower and partially consumed by multi-tenancy compared to our brand new dedicated, isolated CPUs. (I was curious about this, so I just spun up a new $160/month DO instance for a quick test. The
       <code>
        sysbench
       </code>
       results are 4086 and 11760 respectively, considerably below the 2019 Mini-PC results, above.) As you can see,
       <strong>
        you pay almost three times as much for a cloud server.
       </strong>
       🤑
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is for everyone. If you just need to spin up a quick server or two for testing and experimentation, there's absolutely no way you need to go to the trouble and up-front cost of building and then racking colocated mini-pcs. There's no denying that spinning servers up in the cloud offers unparalleled flexibility and redundancy. But if you do have need for
       <strong>
        dedicated computing resources over a period of years
       </strong>
       , then building your own small personal cloud, with machines
       <em>
        you actually own
       </em>
       , is not only one third the cost but also … kinda cool?
