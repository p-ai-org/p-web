      Welcome to freedesktop.org
     </h1>
     <p>
      freedesktop.org hosts the development of free and open source software, focused on interoperability and shared technology for open-source graphical and desktop systems. We do not ourselves produce a desktop, but we aim to help others to do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our loose community of projects mostly produce
      <a href="./Software/">
       software
      </a>
      and/or
      <a href="./Specifications/">
       specifications
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <h2 id="softwareprojects">
      Software projects
     </h2>
     <p>
      Most of our member projects produce software to be used as libraries or services. A full list is available at
      <a href="./Software/">
       our software page
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of the software we host is focused on drivers and middleware for graphics and media devices, inter-process communication and authorization, input and internationalization.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the software on freedesktop.org is available as open source and open to community contribution. The
      <a href="./Software/">
       software page
      </a>
      explains how to report bugs and propose changes to each of these projects.
     </p>
     <h2 id="specifications">
      Specifications
     </h2>
     <p>
      We also host discussion and development of specifications for interoperability. A full list is available at
      <a href="./Specifications/">
       our specifications page
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      These specifications mostly cover low-level desktop issues, such as identifying file types, launching applications, and exchanging data between applications and desktops. They are often called 'XDG' specifications, as an acronym for the
      <em>
       Cross-Desktop Group
      </em>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      freedesktop.org is not a formal standards body, and is not in itself a platform; we do not have a compliance test nor a certification. Anyone is free to use and implement the specifications on this site; the
      <a href="./Specifications/">
       specifications page
      </a>
      explains how to propose changes and existing specifications, or entirely new specifications.
     </p>
     <h2 id="infrastructure">
      Infrastructure
     </h2>
     <p>
      The infrastructure we use to provide these services to our projects is documented on
      <a href="./Infrastructure/">
       our infrastructure page
      </a>
      . You can quickly get access to
      <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org">
       our GitLab instance
      </a>
      where most of our code lives,
      <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org">
       our mailing lists
      </a>
      , or browse these wiki pages further to find out more.
     </p>
     <h2 id="gettinginvolved">
      Getting Involved
     </h2>
     <p>
      We welcome all new contributors, whatever your skill set, and aim to be a place you can learn and grow as an open-source contributor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The first point of entry is to find the project you would like to work on, usually through our
      <a href="./Software/">
       software
      </a>
      or
      <a href="./Specifications/">
       specifications
      </a>
      page. Each project should have a clear link of how to report issues, discuss changes, and contribute back - this will almost certainly be on that project's page on
      <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org">
       our GitLab instance
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      If you would like to create a new freedesktop.org project, or request hosting of an existing project you would like to move here, please see
      <a href="./NewProject/">
       the new project page
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <h2 id="codeofconduct">
      Code of Conduct
     </h2>
     <p>
      freedesktop.org has adopted the Contributor Covenant for all the services we host. Please conduct yourself in an appropriate manner, avoiding abusive, bullying, and/or discriminatory behaviour. For more information, including where to report any inappropriate behaviour, please consult the full

     <h2 id="privacyandpersonalinformation">
      Privacy and personal information
     </h2>
     <p>
      When you use freedesktop.org services, you might disclose personally-identifying information to us. Our
      <a href="./PrivacyPolicy/">
       Privacy Policy
      </a>
      explains how we collect and use this data.
     </p>
     <h2 id="contactus">
      Contact us
     </h2>
     <p>
      If you have questions about the site itself or our infrastructure, the administrators can be reached on the
      <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/sitewranglers">
       sitewranglers list
      </a>
      , or also on Freenode's #freedesktop IRC channel. Platform-wide announcements and discussions are generally on the
      <a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/freedesktop">
       freedesktop mailing list
      </a>
      .
     </p>
     <p>
      Please note that it may take some time to answer your question on IRC, and we are also unlikely to be able to help with project-specific issues (e.g. 'why does ModemManager crash?'). Questions or issues with a specific member project should be directed to that project's own mailing list or bug tracker.
